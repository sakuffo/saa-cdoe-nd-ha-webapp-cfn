# Sample UserData
# When creating your Launch Configuration, you may need a UserData script
# here's one that you can use for Ubuntu Linux that will:
# Install Apache Web Server, Start it, and create an index.html that will be displayed
# when you visit the IP address of this server with your web browser
#Here it is:
#
#          #!/bin/bash
#          apt-get update -y
#          apt-get install apache2 -y
#          systemctl start apache2.service
#          cd /var/www/html
#          echo "Udacity Demo Web Server Up and Running!" > index.html
